# Pong-Game
This is a Pong game clone built in Python using the turtle graphics module

- Two paddles (left and right) move up and down to hit a bouncing ball.
- The ball bounces off the top and bottom walls and the paddles.
- If a paddle misses the ball, the opposing player scores a point.
- The scoreboard keeps track of the left and right player scores.

It is a simple two-player arcade game where the goal is to outscore your opponent by hitting the ball past their paddle.
